# Exercise application: Suppliers

This is a basic sample Rails application, with a goal to learn Ruby on Rails.

## Requirements

The application should have the following models:

* suppliers (name, address),
* supplier's products (EAN code, description).

It should allow:

* view a list of suppliers,
* add a new supplier,
* view supplier's products,
* add a product for a supplier.

There's no need for fancy design. Minimal CSS is enough.
